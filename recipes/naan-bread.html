    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Soft and pillowy naan is easy to make at home, and it's a world apart from
      store-bought.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all purpose flour, plus more for rolling</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon instant dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon anise seeds (optional)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>¾ cup warm water (about 100°F)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons melted salted butter</li>
      <li>
        1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley (optional), for serving
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, yeast, salt, and anise
        seeds.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, whisk together yogurt, olive oil, and ¾ cup warm
        water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the yogurt mixture to the dry ingredients and mix with a fork.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the dough is about to come together, dust your hands with flour and
        knead gently into a soft, slightly sticky dough. Add more flour if
        needed to prevent stickiness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly oil or spray a clean bowl with nonstick cooking spray (large
        enough for the dough to double in size).
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the dough to the prepared bowl, cover with plastic wrap or a
        damp kitchen towel, and let it sit in a warm place for 1 to 1½ hours, or
        until about doubled in size.
      </li>
      <li>Fill a small bowl with about ½ cup of flour.</li>
      <li>Dust a work surface with some flour and place the dough on it.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle some flour on top of the dough and on your hands.</li>
      <li>
        Shape the dough into a long rectangle and cut it into 6 equal portions,
        dusting with more flour as necessary to prevent sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Warm a large cast iron or heavy nonstick pan over medium-high heat until
        very hot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll one of the dough balls into an oval shape about ⅛-inch thick
        (approximately 9 x 4 inches) using a rolling pin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pick up the dough and flip it back and forth between your hands to
        remove excess flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently lay the dough in the dry skillet and cook until the top has air
        bubbles and the bottom is golden and blackened in spots.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flip the naan and cook for 1-2 minutes more until the bottom is lightly
        browned and blistered in spots.
      </li>
      <li>Remove the naan from the skillet and brush it with melted butter.</li>
      <li>Place the naan in a tea towel-lined dish to keep warm.</li>
      <li>
        Repeat the process with the remaining naan, adjusting the heat as
        needed.
      </li>
      <li>Sprinkle with parsley, if desired, and serve the naan warm.</li>
    </ol>
