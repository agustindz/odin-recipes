    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Say goodbye to dry, bland grilled chicken breasts. This recipe guarantees
      juicy, flavorful chicken every time.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1¾ lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>4 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1½ teaspoons lemon zest, from one lemon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        One at a time, place the chicken breasts in a 1-gallon zip-lock bag;
        using a meat mallet, pound to an even ½-inch thickness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix all of the ingredients except for the chicken together in a 1-gallon
        zip-lock bag.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken breasts to the bag and massage the marinade into the
        meat until evenly coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Seal the bag and place in a bowl in the refrigerator (the bowl protects
        against leakage); let the chicken marinate for at least 4 hours or
        overnight.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the grill to high heat and oil the grates.</li>
      <li>
        Place the chicken breasts on the grill and cook, covered, for 2 to 3
        minutes per side.
      </li>
    </ol>
